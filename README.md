# Presence Calculator for NZ Citizenship

You can still do a manual check as often as you like, but... I prefer to letting the robot do it.

ID information are stored in **customer.csv**.

For manual check, see https://dia.services.govt.nz/presence-calculator/ .

There is a catch. DIA uses API from INZ and would always ask you to contact INZ if you have any concerns about the result returned by the presence calculator. I submitted a query in April as I planned to apply for citizenship in July. After several email exchanges between me, DIA/INZ/MBIE, today, the 27th Sep, a DIA officer investigated my question and confirmed that I met the presence criteria. Also, the officer told me, ‘Occasionally, an older temporary visa without a start or end date in Immigration’s system means the calculation is unsuccessful’, which seems to me someone used the wrong join type.

Special thanks to officer C.Y. It wouldn’t have come to a solution if it were not for your persistent and kind help.
